# Homework 1 Assigment -01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## 01-Homework Repository

This repository is where my first homework assigment for refactoring takes place. As I move along in the course, I hope to have learned how to write better README files.

### Changes

A large part of the refactoring process was done in the style.css file. Head class was changed to Header in the body of the HTML and the CSS was also updated to reflect the changes. Once reviewing redundant CSS, I merged what I could find that was using the same padding, margin, float, font-family, and font-size together as one entry.

Another large consolidation was the IMG stylings that used the same margins, padding, floating, width, etc. throughout the CSS.
